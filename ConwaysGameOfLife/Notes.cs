            Rules use how many neighbours a cell has
            * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.  
            * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.  
            * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.  
            * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
